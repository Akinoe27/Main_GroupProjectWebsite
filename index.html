          <h2>Organic Backyard Farming for Everyone: The Future of Food</h2>
          <p>
            Organic farming, is a first step to combat social issues that we are
            facing like hunger and if this becomes a household practice, it can
            maximize the production and minimize the cost of food with little
            regard to impacts on the environment. As the world enters an era in
            which global food production is likely to double, it is critical
            that agricultural practices be modified to minimize environmental
            impacts even though many such practices are likely to increase the
            costs of production.

          <h4>Vermiculture </h4>
          <p>   
            Means artificial rearing or cultivation of worms (Earthworms) and the technology is the 
            scientific process of using them for the betterment of human beings. Vermicompost is the 
            excreta of earthworm, which is rich in humus.
            It has a lot of beneficial components like maintaining Ph balance as well as retaining soil’s 
            moisture content which is ideal for tropical countries like in the Philippines. Unlike the normal 
            Urea fertilizer, it doesn’t destroy the soil’s living organism but rather, helping them to thrive 
            in the world’s changing temperature. Ultimately, this method helps our growing needs while giving 
            respect to soil’s original structure. You can check the article below for complete instructions

          <h4>Aquaponics </h4>
          <p>
            It is a cooperation between plants and fish and the term originates from the two words aquaculture 
            (the growing of fish in a closed environment) and hydroponics (the growing of plants usually in a 
            soil-less environment).This method is hitting 2 birds in 1 stone; maintaining your home-grown fish, 
            clean and healthy while growing your own food without excess usage of water and additional cost for 
            filters. For more tips on how to start, follow the link below:

          <h4>Organic pigs </h4>
          <p>
            It is going back to the basic way of raising pigs in a more liberating and non-restrictive 
            environment where they can do whatever they want. It has access to outdoors, shade, shelter, 
            exercise areas, fresh air, clean drinking water, and direct sunlight as suitable for the 
            animal's stage of life, the climate, and the environment.Historically, pigs are just roaming 
            around the earth and have proven to have a vital role in micro-organisms due to their way of 
            living. For more tips on how to start your own, you can follow the link below:

          <h4>Organic chicken</h4>
          <p>
           It has access to an abundance of fresh air, daylight and outdoor space. These chickens 
           are fed only organic feed that is adapted to this slow-growing breed. Similar to Organic 
           pigs, they are also known to be found in the wild and plays a vital role in the food chain.
           The most practical way of raising chickens is letting them live in a non-restrictive 
           environment with the ability to feed on their own. This way, it is proven that their 
           egg-produce is found to be healthier and it less expensive. For more information,

          <h4>Hydroponics</h4>
          <p>Is the technique of growing plants using a water-based nutrient solution rather 
            than soil, and can include an aggregate substrate, or growing media, such as vermiculite
            , coconut coir, or perlite. Hydroponic production systems are used by small farmers, 
            hobbyists, and commercial enterprises. Unlike the Aquaponics, it nurture plants, 
            under water treatment but with no fish beneath involved.This method produce a greater 
            yield of fruits and vegetables because in a hydroponic system plants are more densely 
            spaced together compared to the size of land that would be needed to grow the same 
            number of plants. For more information, you can follow the link below:

        A. Organic farming, also known as ecological farming or biological farming,
         is an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of organic origin such as 
         compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques 
         such as crop rotation and companion planting. It originated early in the 
         20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Certified 
         organic agriculture accounts for 70 million hectares (170 million acres) 
         globally, with over half of that total in Australia. Organic farming 
         continues to be developed by various organizations today. Biological 
         pest control, mixed cropping, and the fostering of insect predators are 
         encouraged. Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally-occurring 
         substances while prohibiting or strictly limiting synthetic substances. 
         For instance, naturally-occurring pesticides such as pyrethrin are permitted, 
         while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides are generally prohibited. Synthetic 
         substances that are allowed include, for example, copper sulfate, elemental sulfur, 
         and ivermectin. Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, 
         plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are 
         prohibited. Organic farming advocates claim advantages in sustainability, openness, 
         self-sufficiency, autonomy and independence,[11] health, food security, and food safety.

        A. The most important
            benefits of organic farming is that it ensures the health of the
            farmlands and it leads to production of food products that are more
            nutritional, and among other benefits. Organic farming can also be a 
            big factor that can address socio-economic
            issues of it will be implemented on every household.
            Food production has now
            been threatened by various factors such as climate change, war and
            land conversion, to name a few. In the Philippines, although the
            impact is imminent, organic farming has a slim chance to become a
            national practice, making the farming method unknown to most
            Filipinos. The dissemination of information about organic farming is
            too bland and not so many. If fully implemented, this could address
            socio-economic issues such as: Food shortage, dependence on
            importation and malnutrition, carbon emission due to food waste and
            creating more jobs in Agricultural sector.

        A. Space is not always an issue for an organic farm.
            If you have a wide-stretching garden or terrace, it serves as a
            benefit. But residing in an apartment should not come in the way of
            your organic farming dreams. There are so may DIY videos that could help 
            us start with having it in our home, so let's start and have our own
